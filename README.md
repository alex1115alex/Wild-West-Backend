Wild West is an anonymous local-area chat website designed around the values of privacy and freedom of speech.

In Wild West, users are identified by codes that are randomly generated on the client side, and can be reset whenever. In theory, this means users can reset their code, making it impossible for an advisary to determine the original poster.
